    \frametitle{Method}
    The method we chose to use for evaluating disagreement in the review is one of the methods presented in (\cite{Amer-YahiaSihem2009Grsa}).
    Method is based on the idea that high variance in ratings given to an item amongst a group indicates that the item in question is not 
    relevant to the group.

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Disagreement function}
    First we need to calculate disagreement variance for the item $i$ in the group $g$.
    \begin{align*}
        dis(g,i) = \frac{1}{|g|}\sum \limits _{u\in g} (r^{*}(u, i) - mean)^2
    \end{align*}
    where $r^*(u,i)$ is the rating given by user $u$ to item $i$ and $mean$ is the mean of ratings given by the group to item $i$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Consensus function}
    The disagreement is then taken into account with
    a consensus function. Consensus balances the groups aggregation score with the disagreement score with weights $w_1$ and $w_2$.
    \begin{align*}
        con(g,i) = w_1 \times r^{*}(g,i) + w_2 \times (1-dis(g,i))
    \end{align*}
 where $w_1 + w_2 = 1$ and $r^{*}$ is the average aggregation function.
